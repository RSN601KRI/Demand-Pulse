**Walmart DemandPulse** is an AI-powered retail intelligence platform that predicts demand, explains trends using generative AI, and optimizes inventory allocation across stores to reduce waste and improve customer satisfaction.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Walmart faces persistent challenges with product overstocking and understocking, particularly during seasonal peaks and promotions. These imbalances lead to revenue loss, customer dissatisfaction, and operational inefficiencies in last-mile delivery and fulfilment.

According to industry reports, inefficiencies in supply chains cost retailers billions, and the AI in the supply chain market is projected to exceed $45 billion by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent, localised demand planning.

- 🤖 **Generative AI Insights**: Get simple, human-friendly explanations for demand spikes through a built-in chatbot.
- 🔄 **Inventory Optimisation**: Receive real-time recommendations for stock reallocation between stores to reduce mismatch.
- 📊 **Visual Analytics**: Interactive graphs, trend lines, and actionable summaries for managers.
- 💬 **Real-Time Insights**: Query the system to gain a deeper understanding of product trends, risks, and future outlooks.
